## Cartesi Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Cartesi Number Guessing Game! This project is a fun and interactive way to engage with the Cartesi platform. Here's how it works:

## Game Rules

1. A random number is generated.
2. Users submit their guesses through the dApp.
3. If a user's guess is incorrect, a notice is created.
4. If a user inputs an invalid number, a report is created.
5. If a user guesses the correct number, a voucher is created for them to mint an NFT.
